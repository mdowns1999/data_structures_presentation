# Learning Data Structures Presentation Overview

This project is a simple presentation on three kinds of data structures.  The purpose of this is to demonstrate my understanding of these data structures and show that I can explain it to another individual.  The presentation contains diagrams and explanations about each data structure.  I also provided code examples, practice problems, and solutions to those practice problems.

# Development Environment

I simply used python to show these examples.  I used Visual Studio code by Microsoft to run the code, but if someone was learning from this presentation, they can copy and paste the code into whatever editor they prefer. 

# Future Work
* Add more data strucuture items
* Possibly show examples in other languages
